# Windswept Banner

A piece for fixed media.
This repository contains the scripts used to generate the sounds that are a part of the piece.

Running `earthquake.m` outputs the sound of the specific earthquake found in `earthquake.xml`, normalized and played at 44100 Hz. 
Note: the script depends on JavaScript and MATLAB function developed by IRIS, located here: https://github.com/iris-edu/irisFetch-matlab/releases.

Running `script.m` outputs a probabilistically determined audio file at 24 bits, 44100 Hz called `audio.wav`.
